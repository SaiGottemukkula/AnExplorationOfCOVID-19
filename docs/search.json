I enjoy learning about tech, as well as biking\r\nwith my friends, and playing tennis whenever I can.\r\nAbout the site\r\nI chose to do a project based on the Coronavirus pandemic because it\r\nwas a global event that completely changed the lives of the current\r\ngeneration, affecting everything from education to jobs. I also felt\r\nlike I would have done a disservice to all the people that it affected\r\nif I did not select the pandemic as my topic.\r\nContact links\r\nE-mail: saigthefirst@gmail.com\r\nGithub: https://github.com/SaiGottemukkula\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For the states, I chose California, Massachusetts, Michigan, and\r\nWyoming. The data is from the CDC, and the number of cases is for\r\nChristmas 2021. The results that I got are surprising!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe graph above shows the confirmed cases for four different\r\nstates for Christmas 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, the graph shows the probable cases for the sames\r\nstates, on the same day. Again, the date is for Christmas 2021. See the\r\nmassive difference?\r\nAnalysis\r\nAs you can probably see, the graphs show that the probable cases\r\naren’t exactly very accurate. In fact, they’re off by thousands of\r\ncases! This shows that our predictions can use some improvements.\r\nAdditionally, the data was taken from Christmas 2021, when cases were\r\nexpected to grow greatly. Because analysts expected spike during a major\r\nholiday and still underestimated the number of cases, it’s reasonable to\r\nexpect that our predictions would usually be much lower than the actual\r\ncases.\r\n(Disease Control and Prevention 2022)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisease Control, Centers for, and Prevention. 2022.

Although it’s not\r\nuseful for making any inferences, it’s just interesting to see which\r\nstate performed better.\r\nAccording to worldpopulationreview, Hawaii is the most liberal state,\r\nWyoming is the most conservative state, and Oregon is the most neutral.\r\nI’ll use these for my comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe graph shows that Hawaii’s cases have started to peak, and the\r\nline may eventually go down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, you can see that the line curves upwards, and shows that the\r\ncases for Wyoming are increasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, this is the data for Oregon. Oregon is split evenly, with 30%\r\nof the population being conservative, and with another 30% being\r\nliberal. Most people would expect Oregon’s cases to be in between that\r\nof Hawaii and Wyoming, but Oregon has the most cases out of all\r\nthree!\r\nAnalysis\r\nThe two graphs show that Hawaii did slightly better than Wyoming at\r\nthe start of the pandemic, as it had less deaths with the same amount of\r\ncases as Wyoming. However, Oregon has more cases than both of those\r\nstates, which is unexpected, as most people would have expected it to\r\nhave COVID-19 cases that were in between Hawaii and Wyoming.\r\n(Disease Control and Prevention 2022)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisease Control, Centers for, and Prevention. 2022.
