I enjoy learning about tech, as well as biking\r\nwith my friends, and playing tennis whenever I can.\r\nAbout the site\r\nI chose to do a project based on the Coronavirus pandemic because it\r\nwas a global event that completely changed the lives of the current\r\ngeneration, from education to jobs, and I felt like I would have done a\r\ndisservice to all the people that it affected if I did not select the\r\nvirus as my topic.\r\nContact links\r\nE-mail: saigthefirst@gmail.com\r\nGithub: https://github.com/SaiGottemukkula\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For the states, I chose California, Massachusetts, Michigan, and\r\nWyoming. The data is from the CDC, and the number of cases is for\r\nChristmas 2021. The results that I got are surprising!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe graph above shows the confirmed cases for four different\r\nstates for Christmas 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, the graph shows the probable cases for the sames\r\nstates, on the same day. Again, the date is for Christmas 2021.\r\nAnalysis\r\nAs you can see, the graphs show that the probable cases aren’t\r\nexactly very accurate. In fact, they’re off by thousands of cases! This\r\nshows that our predictions can use some improvements. Additionally, the\r\ndata was taken from Christmas 2021, when cases were expected to grow\r\ngreatly. Because analysts expected spike during a major holiday and\r\nstill underestimated the number of cases, it’s reasonable to expect that\r\nour predictions would usually be much lower than the actual cases.\r\n(Disease Control and Prevention 2022)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisease Control, Centers for, and Prevention. 2022.

Although it’s not\r\nuseful for making any inferences, it’s just interesting to see which\r\nstate performed better. According to worldpopulationreview, Hawaii is\r\nthe most liberal state, Wyoming is the most conservative state, and\r\nOregon is the most neutral. I’ll use these for my comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe graph shows that Hawaii’s cases have started to peak, and are\r\ncurving downwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, you can see that the line curves upwards, and shows that the\r\ncases for Wyoming are increasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, this is the data for Oregon. Oregon is split evenly, with 30%\r\nof the population being conservative, and with another 30% being\r\nliberal. Most people would expect Oregon’s cases to be in between that\r\nof Hawaii and Wyoming, but Oregon has the most cases out of all\r\nthree!\r\nAnalysis\r\nThe two graphs show that Hawaii did slightly better than Wyoming at\r\nthe start of the pandemic, as it had less deaths with the same amount of\r\ncases as Wyoming. However, Oregon has more cases than both of those\r\nstates, which is unexpected, as most people would have expected it to\r\nhave COVID-19 cases that were in between Hawaii and Wyoming.\r\n(Disease Control and Prevention 2022)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisease Control, Centers for, and Prevention. 2022.
