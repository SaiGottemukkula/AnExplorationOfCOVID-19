I enjoy learning about tech, as well as biking\r\nwith my friends, and playing tennis whenever I can.\r\nAbout the site\r\nI chose to do a project based on the Coronavirus pandemic because it\r\nwas a global event that completely changed the lives of the current\r\ngeneration, from education to jobs, and I felt like I would have done a\r\ndisservice to all the people that it affected if I did not select the\r\nvirus as my topic.\r\nContact links\r\nE-mail: saigthefirst@gmail.com\r\nGithub: https://github.com/SaiGottemukkula\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The results that I got were quite surprising!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe graph above shows the confirmed cases for four different\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, the graph shows the probable cases for the sames\r\nstates, on the same day.\r\nAnalysis\r\nAs you can see, the graphs show that the probable cases aren’t\r\nexactly very accurate. In fact, they’re off by thousands of cases! This\r\nshows that our predictions can use some improvements.\r\n(Disease Control and Prevention 2022)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisease Control, Centers for, and Prevention. 2022.

According to worldpopulationreview, Hawaii is the most\r\nblue state, and Wyoming is the most red state. I’ll use those for my\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe graph shows that Hawaii’s cases have started to peak, and are\r\ncurving downwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, you can see that the line curves upwards, and shows that the\r\ncases for Wyoming are increasing.\r\nAnalysis\r\nThe two graphs show that Hawaii did slightly better than Wyoming at\r\nthe start of the pandemic, as it had less deaths with the same amount of\r\ncases as Wyoming.\r\n(Disease Control and Prevention 2022)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisease Control, Centers for, and Prevention. 2022.
