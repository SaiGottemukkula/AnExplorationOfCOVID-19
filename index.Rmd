  Welcome to my final project for the datascience bootcamp!
site: distill::distill_website

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(ggthemes)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
```
For my project, I'm going to use the data from the CDC. Here's the tibble that I'm going to be using:

```{r}
data <- read_csv(file = "United_States_COVID-19_Cases_and_Deaths_by_State_over_Time.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
data
```

With this table, we can access a large amount of data on COVID-19. For example, I can access information about total cases and deaths, as well as daily stats.
