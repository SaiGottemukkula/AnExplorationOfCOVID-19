## Welcome to the 'About' page!

My name is Sai Gottemukkula, and I'm currently a rising junior at Lexington High School. I enjoy learning about tech, as well as biking with my friends, and playing tennis whenever I can.

## About the site

I chose to do a project based on the Coronavirus pandemic because it was a global event that completely changed the lives of the current generation, from education to jobs, and I felt like I would have done a disservice to all the people that it affected if I did not select the virus as my topic.
