## Welcome to the 'About' page!

My name is Sai Gottemukkula, and I'm currently a rising junior at Lexington High School. I enjoy learning about tech, as well as biking with my friends, and playing tennis whenever I can.

## About the site

I chose to do a project based on the Coronavirus pandemic because it was a global event that completely changed the lives of the current generation, affecting everything from education to jobs. I also felt like I would have done a disservice to all the people that it affected if I did not select the pandemic as my topic.

## Data Science
I made this website as a final project for David Kane's free datascience bootcamp!
